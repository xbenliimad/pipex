	Creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be
	used for interprocess communication.  The array pipefd is used to
	return two file descriptors referring to the ends of the pipe.
	pipefd[0] refers to the read end of the pipe.  pipefd[1] refers
	to the write end of the pipe.  Data written to the write end of
	the pipe is buffered by the kernel until it is read from the read
	end of the pipe.
